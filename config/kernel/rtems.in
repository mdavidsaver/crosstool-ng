config RTEMS_TOOLCHAIN_NAME
  string
  prompt "RTEMS kernel name in toolchain"
  default "rtems"
  help
    Select the kernel part of the toolchain name.
    By conventions RTEMS includes part, or all, of the kernel version
    For example, "rtems4.10" might give a toolchain "powerpc-rtems4.10".
    Useful to allow multiple toolchain versions to be installed side by side.
